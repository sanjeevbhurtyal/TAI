>Analyzing **470 million trips** across TransLink's network (2022-2025) to uncover travel patterns, mode preferences, and payment trends.
>{: .text-grey-dk-300 .fs-3 }
>**Key Findings:** 
>{: .text-black-dk-300 .fs-3 }
>- 🚌 **Bus dominates with 62% mode share** in 2025 (64% growth since 2022)
>- ⛴️ **Ferry** shows explosive 172% growth from small 4% base in 2025
>- 💳 **EMV adoption surged to 30%+ within six months** since April 2025, with ferries leading at >50%.
>- 📍 **Brisbane CBD dominates all top origin-destination pairs**, confirming monocentric economy. 
>- 📍 **Corridors like St. Lucia and Woolloongabba** rely almost entirely on buses, creating vulnerability during disruptions.
>- **Growth is spatially uneven**: Springfield Central and Bowen Hills grew 35%+ while Donnan and Riverbend declined 80%, requiring targeted intervention.

>This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of feature engineering in machine learning through a controlled experiment using London bike sharing demand forecasting.
>{: .text-grey-dk-300 .fs-3 }
>
>**Key Findings:**
>{: .text-grey-dk-300 .fs-3 }
>- 🎯 Well-engineered features improved all four models (SARIMAX, XGBoost, LSTM, Prophet) by 5-22% across metrics
>- 📈 LSTM showed highest sensitivity (22% improvement); complex models benefit most from rich features
>- ⚠️ Naive daily aggregation destroyed temporal patterns; time-of-day segmentation preserved critical information
>- 🏆 Prophet achieved best performance, but universal improvement proves feature engineering is foundational
